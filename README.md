* For Python: a working Python >= 3.x environment with Requests library. Official project page: https://pypi.org/project/requests/;
* Ability in your environment to run cURL POST requests (check your networks rules if any). To try it, use http://mockbin.com/ for example.

## Installation

1. Clone or download your preferedd script example;
2. Modify it by entering your own API token and required parameters, such as image URL;
3. Copy this script file in your PHP or Python environment;
4. When required, please ensure this script has the rights to create a file in his current folder;
4. For PHP, start your preferred Web browser and reach you script, for example `https://www.mywebsite/ai/image-asciify.php`;
